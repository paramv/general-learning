# Introduction to Navigation

* Give feedback as to current location: “You are here.” In other words, show visitors where they are currently located in relation to the entire site. Psychologists call this grounding: locating a known reference point in a foreign information space.

## Navigation Principles

We are going to look at several general principles that underlie every decision in designing navigation:

* Create simple, visible, consistent navigation.
* Take advantage of what visitors already know.
* Orient visitors with “You Are Here” markers.
* Minimize visitor effort.
* Provide multiple ways to access information.
* Provide for visitors with varied skill levels.
* Provide feedback.
* Make sure the navigation is flexible and expandable.

__The Rule of Seven, which states that the average person can remember or comprehend only seven discrete elements (plus or minus two) at a time.__

_As width-by-height resolution increases, pixels get smaller, as do the all of the elements on the screen that are made up of those pixels. As monitor size increases, pixels get bigger, as do all of the elements on the screen._

_If you want to be certain that visitors can safely print the entire page in the browser’s portrait orientation, you should cut down the page size even further, to only 535 pixels horizontally._
