# Understanding Users: Qualitative Research
The qualitative research activities we have found to be most useful in our practice are:

* Stakeholder interviews
* Subject matter expert (SME) interviews
* User and customer interviews
* User observation/ethnographic field studies
* Literature reviewProduct/prototype and competitive audits 

## Ethnographic Interviews: Interviewing and Observing Users
The technique of ethnographic interviews is a combination of immersive observation and directed interview techniques.

### Contextual inquiry
Based on a master-apprentice model of learning: observing and asking questions of the user as if she is the master craftsman, and the interviewer the new apprentice. 

* Context - interview user in his/her own environment
* Partnership
* Interpretation 
* Focus - avoid questionnaire's and go ad-hoc

### The persona hypothesis
The first step towards identifying and synthesizing personas. Should be based on likely behavior patterns and the factors that differentiate these patterns, not purely on demographics.
The persona hypothesis attempts to address, at a high level, these three questions:

* What different sorts of people might use this product?
* How might their needs and behaviors vary?
* What ranges of behavior and types of environments need to be explored?

### Goal-oriented questions
* Goals
* Opportunities
* Priorities
* Information - What helps you make decisions?

### System-oriented question
* Function - What are the most common things you do with the product?
* Frequency - What parts of the product do you use most?
* Preference - What are your favorite aspects of the product? What drives you crazy?
* Failure - How do you work around problems?
* Expertise - What shortcuts do you employ?

### Workflow-oriented questions
* Process - What did you do when you first came in today? And after that?
* Occurrence and recurrence - How often do you do this? What things do you do weekly or monthly, but not every day?
* Exception - What constitutes a typical day? What would be an unusual event?

### Attitude-oriented questions
* Aspiration - What do you see yourself doing five years from now?
* Avoidance - What would you prefer not to do? What do you procrastinate on?
* Motivation - What do you enjoy most about your job (or lifestyle)? What do you always tackle first?
