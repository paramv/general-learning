# The Foundations of Design: Scenarios and Requirements

## Scenarios: Narrative as a Design Tool

Narrative, or storytelling, is one of the oldest human activities. Much has been written about the power of narrative to communicate ideas.

### Scenarios in design

__Scenario__, commonly used to describe a method of design problem solving by concretization: making use of a specific story to both construct and illustrate design solutions.

### Using personas in scenarios

__Persona-based scenarios__ are concise narrative descriptions of one or more personas using a product to achieve specific goals. 

### Types of scenarios

* Context scenarios -  created before any design is performed and are written from the perspective of the persona, focused on human activities, perceptions, and desires.
* Key path scenarios - specifically describing user interactions with the product and by introducing the vocabulary of the design. These scenarios focus on the most significant user interactions, always maintaining attention on how a persona uses the product to achieve their goals.
* Validation scenarios - test the design solution in a variety of situations. These scenarios tend to be less detailed and typically take the form of a number of “what if . . .” questions about the proposed solutions. 

### Persona-based scenarios versus use cases

**_Goal-Directed scenarios_ are an iterative means of defining the behavior of a product from the standpoint of specific users (personas)**
**_Use cases_ are a technique based on exhaustive descriptions of functional requirements of the system, often of a transactional nature, focusing on low-level user action and accompanying system response.**

## Requirements: The "What" of Interaction Design

_While there is clearly a relationship between requirements and functions (which we leverage as a key part of our design process, as you will see in the next chapter), we suggest that you think of requirements as synonymous with needs._

## Requirements Definition Using Personas and Scenarios

__Requirements Definition__ answers the broad questions about what a product is and what it should do, and __Framework Definition__ answers questions about how a product behaves and how it is structured to meet user goals.

The Requirements Definition process comprises the following five steps

* Creating problem and vision statements
* Brainstorming
* Identifying persona expectations
* Constructing context scenarios
* Identifying requirements

### Creating problem and vision statements

A __design problem statement__ should concisely reflect a situation that needs changing, for both the personas and for the business providing the product to the personas. 

The __vision statement__ is an inversion of the problem statement that serves as a high-level design objective or mandate, you lead with the user’s needs, and you transition from those to how business goals are met by the design vision.

The content of both the problem and vision statements should come directly from research and user models. User goals and needs should derive from the primary and secondary personas, and business goals should be extracted from stakeholder interviews.

### Brainstorming

The primary purpose here is to eliminate as much preconception as possible, allowing designers to be open-minded and flexible as they use their imagination to construct scenarios, and use their analytic minds to derive requirements from these scenarios. 

###  Identifying persona expectations

For each primary and secondary persona, you must identify

* Attitudes, experiences, aspirations, and other social, cultural, environmental, and cognitive factors that influence the persona’s expectations
* General expectations and desires the persona may have about the experience of using the product
* Behaviors the persona will expect or desire from the product
* How that persona thinks about basic elements or units of data (for example, in an e-mail application, the basic elements of data might be messages and people)

### Constructing context scenarios

__This is where design begins.__ Establish the primary touch points that each primary and secondary persona has with the system (and possibly with other personas). 

Context scenarios address questions such as the following:

* In what setting(s) will the product be used?
* Will it be used for extended amounts of time?
* Is the persona frequently interrupted?
* Are there multiple users on a single workstation or device?
* With what other products will it be used?
* What primary activities does the persona need to perform to meet her goals?
* What is the expected end result of using the product?
* How much complexity is permissible, based on persona skill and frequency of use?
